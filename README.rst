Paper-Chase
===========

A very simple game written for `Pyweek 25 <https://pyweek.org/25/>`_. The theme
for this iteration of PyWeek is "Two Worlds". In this instance the two worlds
are the "real" world and the "paper" world.

This is a side-scrolling chase / avoidance game. You control the stick figure
in the "paper" world. As the figure runs across the paper it encounters various
"real" world objects blocking its path (pens, cups, erasers, staplers, bananas
etc...) and needs to avoid or destroy them (in some yet to be determined way).

As the game progresses the "real" objects come more often and the pace of the
game speeds up.

You get a point for each step forward.

The wider point of the game is educational:

* I'm using Dan Pope's amazing PyGame Zero and writing the code using the Mu
  editor.
* I aim to create a game that is simple enough that it could be used as a
  "template" or launch pad for teachers and beginner programmers who want to
  write their own games.
* The game will be a single file.
* The game assets will be generated in as simple a manner as possible (i.e.
  something kids could easily copy).
* Post-PyWeek I'm going to write this all up into an educational resource.
